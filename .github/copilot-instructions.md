## Critical


- **Never** include PII (personally identifiable information) or secrets in generated code.
- Commit messages: `type(scope): description`.

## Code quality

- Correct, clear, concise (in that order).
- Meaningful names; avoid globals; comment only when necessary (explain why, not how).
- Composition over inheritance; small, single-responsibility units.

## Design & APIs

- SOLID principles; API-first (`open-api-specification.yml`); versioned APIs (e.g. `/v1/...`); RESTful;

## Security

- Parameterised queries; validate inputs; OAuth 2.0/JWT auth; keep dependencies updated.

## AI use

- Prefer concise responses; avoid restating requirements or unnecessary preamble.
- Do not add comments, docstrings, or type annotations to code you haven't changed.
- When generating code, produce only the changed sections with sufficient context, not entire files.
